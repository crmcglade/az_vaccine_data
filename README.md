What's in here?

originals: These are the original files pulled from ADHS's vaccine data website. 

kindergarten and sixth grade files: These are csvs I created for just kindergarten and sixth grade, respectively. 

code: Here you'll find all my analysis that concatenated the seperate year files into one, cleaned the files and calculated statewide vaccination rates as well as a count on the number of schools that have reached herd immunity.

output_files: these were created from the code in the code folder.
